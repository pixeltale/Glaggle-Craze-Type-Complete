<#4820c0>:Unique Trait:</>		"Boons of the Gods"
Boundary can enter several stances, each granting him 
certain passive benefits while issuing their own 
drawbacks. Stances can be chosen through Craze Techniques,
which are cancellable out of most attacks, but will
briefly lock him out of stance changing.
Bastet Pounce can be cancelled into any move associated
with the current Stance.

mobility while damage decreases

:<#40f840>Osiris</> Stance:		_AA _B^CT

decreases
Makes_SPAura of Osiris a reversal

:<#f8e840>Ptah</> Stance:		_AA _D^CT

is decreased

:<#f84040>Anhur</> Stance:		_AA _F^CT

Using any Craze Cancel will temporarily put Boundary in a
perfect stance, granting him each stance's benefits for a
short period of time, but disabling him from cancelling.
