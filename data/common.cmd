;--|Input Library|--------
;=|optional|======
;If you want to only allow a cancel to be done in a certain amount of time
;you can use Map(MoveCancelTime) defined in the input.zss. You can change 
;value to whatever you wish. 

;Map(CanCancel) - When an attack hits a timer goes off that is based on Map(MoveCancelTime)
;                 This Map will be  true until that timer finishes.

;Map(turncheck) - When this value is set to 1, it means that commands are
;                 not switched based on the opponent being behind you while you are facing the same direction. IE jumping over the opponent
;                 This value is set to 0 by default and is not required. But you must define what triggers you want to set it to one elsewhere.

;Map(LockInput) - When this value is set to 1, it will prevent any inputs from being processed. 
;Map(LockInputSp) - When this value is set to 1, it will prevent any special inputs from being processed. 
;Map(LockInputHy) - When this value is set to 1, it will prevent any hyper inputs from being processed. 

;--using proper charge mechanics: These are defined below and should be in the -1 of your character
;although, you can put it where ever if  you wish to have them be variable options.
;Map(D_ChargeTime);Down charge ala Flash Kick 
;Map(B_ChargeTime);How much time a complete charge is stored
;Map(B_ChargeTime);Back charge ala Sonic Boom 
;Map(B_BufferTime);How much time a complete charge is stored

;===|When using built in charge times|
;Map(B_ChargeReady) will be true if you've stored enough charge frames
;Map(D_ChargeReady) will be true if you stored enough charge frames

;====|Rapid Input instructions|============
;adjusting the "MashCt" map in turtlewax.zss will alter how many times you need
;to press the punch/kick to activate the motion. You still need to use Map(x)/Map(a) in combination
;for proper response. an example is listed below.
;adjusting the "btn6" map in turtlewax.zss will either allow or not allow z/c to be counted as an input for HHSP/HHSK
;by default it is set to 1. futher instructions are in turtlewax.zss to change this.
